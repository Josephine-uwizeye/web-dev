       <p>I’m Josephine. My friends call me “josy” and it just stuck. 
        I love solving problems; I feel excited when I came out with the solution to the issues which is affecting the community</p>
       <p>
        Most of my work is about humanitarian/disaster solution and technology. I believe that affected communities always seek the people who care about them and listen to them. 
        I am passionate about software development and everything tech. I was always fascinated by technology from a very young age, and I have seen it evolve over the years.
